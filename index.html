									<h2><a target="_blank" style="text-align:center;"> Introduction </a></h2>
									
						<p>Dear <b>Hiring Manager</b>, 
                                                                             <br/>I am writing to express my interest in the Data Scientist/Machine Learning Engineer position at your esteemed organization. With a Master’s degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Windsor and extensive experience in data science, machine learning, and advanced analytics, I am eager to bring my skills and expertise to your team.

                                                                             <br/>Currently, I am working as a <b>Data Scientist</b> at <b>Riskthinking.ai</b>, a company focused on developing innovative solutions for financial and climate risk assessment. At Riskthinking.ai, I have been integral in enhancing our data analysis capabilities and delivering impactful projects. Some of my key contributions include:

																			 <br/>Development of a Company Matcher Library: I created a sophisticated library using advanced NLP techniques for text vectorization and cosine similarity, which enables the identification of similar companies. This tool has greatly improved our market and competitor analysis capabilities.

																			 <br/>Computer Vision and Object Detection: I led a project to train and fine-tune the YOLOv5 model on satellite images, successfully deploying it for various object detection categories, which has enhanced our ability to analyze and interpret complex image data.

																			 <br/>NAICS Code Mapping: By fine-tuning the BERT model with data from the NAICS website, I improved our classification accuracy, which is essential for precise industry categorization.

																			 <br/>Chart Detection and Conversion: I developed algorithms to detect and convert various types of charts (bar plots, pie charts, line graphs) into tabular form using Amazon Rekognition for OCR and VGG16 for chart type detection, streamlining our data extraction processes.

																			 <br/>Utilization of OpenAI Models: I leveraged OpenAI API and models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 for tasks such as determining NAICS codes and extracting table content from PDFs, significantly enhancing our data processing and analysis workflows.

																			 <br/>Prior to my role at Riskthinking.ai, I worked as a <b>Machine Learning Scientist</b> at <b>Okos Smart Homes</b>, where I focused on developing AI-backend products and implementing state-of-the-art deep learning techniques such as LSTM, Attention models, and Temporal Fusion Transformers. I also automated machine learning pipelines, utilizing tools like Terraform and Ansible for efficient infrastructure management.

																			 <br/>During my internship at <b>Pratilipi</b>, an Indian startup, I significantly improved customer engagement by enhancing the recommendation system. I applied feature engineering techniques like Jaccard-Index and Cosine-Similarity to better understand user preferences and deliver more accurate content recommendations.

																			 <br/>In addition to my professional experience, I have completed several impactful projects that demonstrate my technical skills and problem-solving abilities:

																			 <br/>Sentiment Analysis: Developed a logistic regression model for sentiment analysis on the Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset and deployed it on an AWS EC2 instance.

																			 <br/>Quora Question Pair Similarity: Built a model to determine if a pair of questions are similar, utilizing EDA, preprocessing, and GloVe word embedding.

																			 <br/>Image Captioning: Implemented an Encoder-Decoder model using VGG16 for feature extraction and LSTM for text data, concatenated for caption generation.

																			 <br/>My technical skills include proficiency in Python, SQL, and experience with cloud platforms like AWS and GCP. I am well-versed in using machine learning libraries such as Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV. My strong foundation in mathematics, statistics, linear algebra, probability, and calculus underpins my work in machine learning.

																			 <br/>I am passionate about leveraging data science and machine learning to solve complex business problems and am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team. I am confident that my background and expertise will allow me to make significant contributions to your organization.

																			 <br/>Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experiences align with your needs. Please find further details in my attached resume and through my portfolio.

																			 <br/>Sincerely,
                                                                             <br/>Kartheek Manda

									<p>Within the field of Deep Learning, the sub-discipline called “<b>Object Detection</b>” involves processes such as identifying the objects through a picture, video or a webcam feed.
									Object Detection is used almost everywhere these days. The use cases are endless, be it Tracking objects, Video surveillance, Pedestrian detection, Anomaly detection, People Counting, Self-driving cars, etc.</p>

									<p><b>Amazon</b> focuses on <b>e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence</b>. As they are strong in e-commerce platforms their review system can be abused by sellers or customers writing fake reviews in exchange for incentives. It is <b>expensive to check each and every review manually and label its sentiment</b>. So a better way is to rely on <b>machine learning/deep learning models</b> for that.

										We will use <b>Logistic regression</b> to build a first-cut solution to the <u><b><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/laowingkin/amazon-fine-food-review-sentiment-analysis" target="_blank" style="text-align:center;"> Amazon Fine Food Reviews Sentiment Analysis</a></b></u> hosted by Kaggle.

										<h2><a href="./Image Segmentation.html">TGS Salt Identification Challenge<br /></a></h2>

									<a href="./Image Segmentation.html" class="image fit"><img src="./images/image_segmentation.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Deep Learning has enabled the field of Computer Vision to advance rapidly in the last few years. In this case study would like to discuss about one specific task in <b>Computer Vision</b> called as <b>Semantic Segmentation</b>. Even though researchers have come up with numerous ways to solve this problem, I will work on a particular architecture namely UNET, which uses a Fully Convolutional Network Model for the task.

										We will use <b>UNET</b> to build a first-cut solution to the <u><b><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/tgs-salt-identification-challenge" target="_blank" style="text-align:center;"> TGS Salt Identification Challenge </a></b></u> hosted by Kaggle.</p>

									<a href="./quora.html" class="image fit"><img src="./images/quora.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>One of the many problems that quora face is the duplication of questions. Duplication of question ruins the experience for both the questioner and the answerer. Since the questioner is asking a duplicate question, we can just show him/her the answers to the previous question. And the answerer doesn’t have to repeat his/her answer for essentially the same questions.</p>

									<p>Just prior to the recent development of Deep Neural Networks this problem was inconceivable even by the most advanced researchers in Computer Vision. But with the advent of Deep Learning this problem can be solved very easily if we have the required dataset.

										This problem was well researched by <u><b><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrej-karpathy-9a650716/" target="_blank" style="text-align:center;"> Andrej Karapathy</a></b></u> in his PhD thesis at Stanford, who is also now the Director of AI at Tesla.</p>
