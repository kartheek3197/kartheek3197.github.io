									<b><p>This is Kartheek Manda Currently working in the field of Machine Learning and Data Science.</b>
										<br/> I have approx. 2 years of experience as a <b>Data Sientist/Machine Learning Scientist</b> at <u><b>Pratilipi and Okos Smart Homes</b></u>. Currently working as a <b>Machine Learning Scientist</b> at <u><b>Okos Smart Homes</b></u>.

									<h2><a target="_blank" style="text-align:center;"> Introduction </a></h2>
									
									  <p>Hi,<br />
										I’m an experienced Data Scientist/Machine Learning Scientist and a Graduate with a master’s degree in Computer Engineering from University of Windsor. I have a strong knowledge and experience in understanding the business problem, analyzing the data and training them with an appropriate model.<br />
										
										<br />Currently working as a <b>Machine Learning Scientist</b> for the <b>Research and Development</b> team to develop the existing AI-backend products. Experience working with <b>Time Series Analysis</b> and Modelling with classical Time series models (MA, AR, ARIMA). I had hands-on experience in building the pipeline for automating the training of models with different models. I have used state of the art deep learning techniques like; <b>LSTM, Attention models, Temporal Fusion Transformers</b> for future prediction. While working with the Temporal Fusion Transformers which was developed by Google, I understood how to read the research paper and in turn use it for our problem. I also worked as a <b>Data Scientist Intern</b> for 9 months at <b>Pratilipi India Limited</b> which is an Indian Startup, where it allows users to post their stories, articles and rate them. I worked with a <b>recommendations team</b>, in which I recommended the users with other content based on the ratings they gave to other content. I have used <b>content-based filtering</b>. I have also worked with graph data to recommend friends. I worked for the Feature Engineering task, where I have come up with <b>Jaccard distance, page rank, HITS score</b> etc. I have joined a diploma program in the year of 2018 and have gained enormous knowledge on Data science and Machine learning. I did my masters and simultaneously I had done case studies on the real time data sets taken from Kaggle, I never felt this field boring as this always excites me to go deep in this field. I have strong knowledge on the mathematics, statistics, linear algebra, probability, and calculus which are the base for Machine Learning. I also have the experience in understanding the business problem and constraints and developing the solution. I performed <b>Exploratory Data analysis</b> and did various preprocessing techniques like normalization, standardization, BOW, and applying them to different models and comparing them. In one case study I have seen all the regression models like: Linear regression, Random Forest regression and Xgboost regression and compared them with respect to performance, time complexity and space complexity. I also have strong knowledge on deploying the machine learning models. I have worked on <b>Image Captioning</b> where I have worked on <b>Encoder-Decoder model</b>, I have used <b>VGG16</b> for fetching the features and used <b>LSTM</b> for fetching the features for the text data. For the decoder part, I have used the <b>Dense layer</b> followed by a <b>Softmax layer</b> for getting the probabilities. I have used the <b>BLEU</b> score for this model and I got <b>0.499250</b> out of 1.<br /> 
										
										<br />In addition to the above-mentioned qualities, I would also bring strong technical skills <b>(Python, Core JAVA, SQL)</b> along with strong communication skills. I have also trained the data with different models and compared them using the <b>performance metrics</b> that we have. I intend to use this opportunity to work in any given assignment efficiently by applying my past experiences and delivering the desired results with <b>minimal supervision</b>.<br />
										
										<br /><b>The attached resume can serve you to provide complete information about my technical skills, experience, and strengths. Thank you for considering my candidacy for this position. I hope to hear from you soon to schedule an interview</b>.<br />
										<br />Sincerely,<br /> 
										Kartheek Manda

									<a href="./object detection.html" class="image fit"><img src="./images/detect.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Within the field of Deep Learning, the sub-discipline called “<b>Object Detection</b>” involves processes such as identifying the objects through a picture, video or a webcam feed.
									Object Detection is used almost everywhere these days. The use cases are endless, be it Tracking objects, Video surveillance, Pedestrian detection, Anomaly detection, People Counting, Self-driving cars, etc.</p>

									<p>A facial recognition system is a technology capable of matching a human face from a digital image or a video frame against a database of faces, typically employed to authenticate users through ID verification services, works by pinpointing and measuring facial features from a given image.</p>

									<p><b>Amazon</b> focuses on <b>e-commerce, cloud computing, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence</b>. As they are strong in e-commerce platforms their review system can be abused by sellers or customers writing fake reviews in exchange for incentives. It is <b>expensive to check each and every review manually and label its sentiment</b>. So a better way is to rely on <b>machine learning/deep learning models</b> for that.

										We will use <b>Logistic regression</b> to build a first-cut solution to the <u><b><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/laowingkin/amazon-fine-food-review-sentiment-analysis" target="_blank" style="text-align:center;"> Amazon Fine Food Reviews Sentiment Analysis</a></b></u> hosted by Kaggle.

										<h2><a href="./Image Segmentation.html">TGS Salt Identification Challenge<br /></a></h2>

									<a href="./Image Segmentation.html" class="image fit"><img src="./images/image_segmentation.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Deep Learning has enabled the field of Computer Vision to advance rapidly in the last few years. In this case study would like to discuss about one specific task in <b>Computer Vision</b> called as <b>Semantic Segmentation</b>. Even though researchers have come up with numerous ways to solve this problem, I will work on a particular architecture namely UNET, which uses a Fully Convolutional Network Model for the task.

										We will use <b>UNET</b> to build a first-cut solution to the <u><b><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/tgs-salt-identification-challenge" target="_blank" style="text-align:center;"> TGS Salt Identification Challenge </a></b></u> hosted by Kaggle.</p>

										<h2><a href="./quora.html">Quora Question Pair Similarity<br /></a></h2>

									<a href="./quora.html" class="image fit"><img src="./images/quora.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>One of the many problems that quora face is the duplication of questions. Duplication of question ruins the experience for both the questioner and the answerer. Since the questioner is asking a duplicate question, we can just show him/her the answers to the previous question. And the answerer doesn’t have to repeat his/her answer for essentially the same questions.</p>

									<p>Just prior to the recent development of Deep Neural Networks this problem was inconceivable even by the most advanced researchers in Computer Vision. But with the advent of Deep Learning this problem can be solved very easily if we have the required dataset.

										This problem was well researched by <u><b><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrej-karpathy-9a650716/" target="_blank" style="text-align:center;"> Andrej Karapathy</a></b></u> in his PhD thesis at Stanford, who is also now the Director of AI at Tesla.</p>
